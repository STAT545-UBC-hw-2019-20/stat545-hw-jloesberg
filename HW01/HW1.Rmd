# __mtcars dataset__
### This data set contains information on car gas comsumption in 1974
#### Some things you could do to explore this data:
* Summarize it:

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```
* Make a histogram:

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

* Compare variables, for example: make a scatter plot of miles per gallon and car weight
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))  + geom_jitter()
```

* Find the mean of one of the variables
```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```
